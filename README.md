TDM-Bootcamp Challenge3 Python Challenge

There are 2 folders in the repo, one for the first problem (PyBank) and a second one for the second problem (PyPoll)

For both problems one had to access csv files and retrieve data from them to make some calculations and return the results with the appropriate format.

I consulted ChatGPT to correct some syntax problems through both codes, as well as consulted it as reference to learn more about some functions and syntax to get the results I needed.
